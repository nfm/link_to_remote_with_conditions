link_to_remote_with_conditions
==============================

This plugin adds the ability to handle conditionals in link_to_remote calls. It
provides two methods:
  - link_to_remote_if(condition, name, options = {}, html_options = nil)
  - link_to_remote_unless(condition, name, options = {}, html_options = nil)

They works in the same manner that link_to_if and link_to_unless do; if the
supplied conditional is true, then it renders a link; if the supplied 
conditional is false, then it simply renders the link's text.

Both methods support the same options as link_to_remote; they are simply 
wrappers around it.

Code for these methods was taken from a patch submitted by Gumaro Melendez to 
the Rails lighthouse issue tracker. You can find the original post here:

Example
=======

# Generates:  <a href="#" onclick="new Ajax.Request('/do/something', 
#             {asynchronous:true, evalScripts:true}); return false;">
#             This is a link</a>
link_to_remote_if true, 'This is a link', :url => do_something_path

# Generates: This is not a link
link_to_remote_unless true, 'This is not a link, :url => do_something_path
